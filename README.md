  <h3>Surface Hopping Nested Instances Training Set for Excited-state Learning</h3>
</div>

SHNITSEL is a curated platform for surface hopping datasets relevant to photochemistry and photophysics. It offers high-quality quantum chemical data (e.g. energies, forces, nonadiabatic couplings) for processes like photodissociation, isomerization, and electrocyclic reactions. Ideal for benchmarking and machine learning applications. Contributions welcome!
